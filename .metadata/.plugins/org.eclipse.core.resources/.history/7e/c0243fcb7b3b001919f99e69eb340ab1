        "Hello! welcome to Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe!\nUltimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a board game composed of nine " + 
        "tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3-by-3 grid. Players take turns playing in the smaller tic-tac-toe boards " + 
        "until one of them wins in the larger tic-tac-toe board.\nEach small 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board is referred to " +
        "as a local board, and the larger 3-by-3 board is referred to as the global board\nThe game starts with X " + 
        "playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots. This move 'sends' their opponent to its relative " + 
        "location. For example, if X played in the top right square of their local board, then O needs to play next " + 
        "in the local board at the top right of the global board. O can then play in any one of the nine available " + 
        "spots in that local board, each move sending X to a different local board.\nIf a move is played so that it " + 
        "is to win a local board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then the entire local board is marked as a " + 
        "victory for the player in the global board.\nOnce the outcome of a local board is decided (win or draw), " + 
        "no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such a board, then that player may play " + 
        "in any other board.\nGame play ends when either a player wins the global board or there are no legal moves " + 
        "remaining, in which case the game is a draw.";

To compile and run this code, please create a new Eclipse project from an existing directory.

The existing directory should be the unzipped folder, 'course', and its contents as they are.

The project can be then run from the main in the TTTDriver.java file (provided on canvas as a template) through eclipse. I have changed this class and added a main that plays this program with input from the command line.

Some notes about the runtime behavior and the behavior of the classes that are implemented:
	Custom runtime exceptions have been implemented. These are as follows and will be thrown if input to the object is provided when the object is not in a valid state:
		InvalidAIOperation
			occurs when an AI attempts to make a move with a coordinate specified (an AI should make a random move)
		InvalidPersonOperation
			occurs when a person attempts to make a move with no coordinate specified
		GameInProgressException
			occurs when a user attempts to create a new player when a game is in progress
		GameNotInProgressException
			occurs when a move is attempted and the game is not in progress (i.e. it has been quit, resulted in a victory, or resulted in a draw)
		InvalidMarkerException
			occurs when an invalid player marker is provided for a player object. often occurs when the marker is more than 1 character long
		TurnTimeoutException
			is thrown when a user takes too long to supply input to the program when it is their turn
